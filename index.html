          <p>Duke Energy’s AI journey began because the utility company had a business problem to
            solve,  Duke Energy chief information officer Bonnie Titone told VentureBeat’s head of
            AI content strategy Hari Sivaraman at the <a href="https://venturebeat.com/tag/Transform-2021">Transform
              2021 virtual
              conference</a> on Thursday.</p>

          <p>Duke Energy was facing some significant challenges, such as the growing issue of <a
            href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/10/31/how-technology-and-policy-can-mitigate-climate-effects-in-an-age-of-colliding-crises/">climate
            change</a> and the need to transition to clean energy in order to reach net zero
            emissions by 2050. Duke Energy is considered an essential service, as it supplies 25
            million people with electricity daily, and everything the <a
              href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/07/07/transform-2021-manufacturings-key-themes/">utility
              company</a> does revolves around a culture of safety and reliability. The variables
            together was a catalyst for exploring AI technologies, Titone said, because whatever the
            company chose to do, it had to support the clean energy transition, deliver value to
            customers, <em>and</em> find a way for employees to work and improve safety.</p>
          <div id="notHumanImg">
          </div>

          <p>“We look to emerging data science tools and AI solutions, which in turn brought us to
            computer vision, and ultimately, drones in order to inspect our solar farms,” Titone
            said.</p>

          <browsispot>
            <div></div>
          </browsispot>

          <p>There is a significant amount of solar farms in the shift to clean energy — Florida alone
            has 3 million solar panels, Titone said — and inspecting them is a very labor-intensive,
            time-consuming, and risky endeavor. It can take about 40 hours to inspect one unit, and
            a relar solar site may have somewhere between 20 and 25 units to inspect. It’s a
            dangerous task, as technicians walk around 500-acre solar sites with heat guns so they

            can inspect the panels and may need to touch live wires. The company began experimenting
            with advanced drones with infrared cameras to try to streamline the work. The
            technicians were able to use the images taken by the drones to determine where they’re
            seeing faults and issues. Thousands of images were stitched together with computer
            vision, giving technicians the ability to look for issues using the images in a much
            safer way, Titone said.</p>

          <browsispot>
            <div></div>
          </browsispot>

          <p>After finding the computer vision, Duke Energy began to consider automating the process.
            The company developed a MOVES model (Mobile Observation Vehicle and Equipment Solutions)
            that collects and processes the data and images from the drones and identifies the
            faults within minutes. Through applying AI and machine learning technologies, the
            program has significantly reduced labor and time costs for the company. Accuracy also
            continued to improve over the time; the latest model used in the inspection reached 91%
            accuracy.</p>

          <browsispot>
            <div></div>
          </browsispot>

          <p>“We compiled that information for the technicians and gave them the ability to navigate
            pretty easily to where we can schedule maintenance for customers, and we did this all
            without a technician ever having to go out to the site,” Titone said. The program has
            led to more than $74 million reductions in cost and 385,000 in man-hours.</p>

          <h2>Cloud and edge processing</h2>

          <p>Duke Energy had to consider the question of how to process the data the drones were
            collecting. A typical drone flight can produce thousands of photos, sometimes with no
            precise location data associated with the images. Trying to do the analysis in the cloud
            to figure out if the drone image showed a solar site would be impossible because of the
            sheer amount of data and information involved. Duke Energy had to process the images at
            the edge so that it could make real-time decisions. The images had to be stitched
            together to make a precise picture of the solar farm without having to require somebody
            go and actually walk around the site.</p>

          <browsispot>
            <div></div>
          </browsispot>

          <p>Instead of trying to do everything at once, Duke Energy worked on small increments of the
            project. Once one thing worked, the team moved on to the next step. Since Duke Energy
            had its own software engineering team, it was able to build its own models with its own
            methodologies as part of a one-stop shop. This process eventually led to creating over
            40 products.</p>

          <browsispot>
            <div></div>
          </browsispot>

          <p>Titone said, “Had we not had that footprint in the cloud journey, we wouldn’t have been
            able to develop these models and be able to process that data as quickly as we could.”
          </p>

          <h2>Working with data</h2>

          <p>Titone also discussed best practices with storing and cleaning data. As the team has
            moved toward a cloud-based data strategy, it uses a lot of <a
              href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/04/28/understanding-when-to-use-a-database-data-lake-or-data-warehouse/">data
              lakes</a>. The data lakes are accessible by other systems and also by some data
            analysis and data science components that must quickly process the information.</p>

          <browsispot>
            <div></div>
          </browsispot>

          <p>“I would say we’re using a lot of the traditional methods around data lakes in order to
            process all of that,” Titone said, and the team models the data with “what we call our
            MATLAB, which stands for machine learning, AI and deep learning."
            “We compiled that information for the technicians and gave them the ability to navigate
            pretty easily to where we can schedule maintenance for customers, and we did this all
            without a technician ever having to go out to the site,” Titone said. The program has
            led to more than $74 million reductions in cost and 385,000 in man-hours.</p>

          <browsispot>
            <div></div>
          </browsispot>

          <p>Reflecting upon the high accuracy that the product reached, Titone said that it was
            important to be OK with failing in the beginning. “I think at the beginning of the
            journey, we didn’t have an expectation that we would get right out of the gate,” she
            said. As time moved on, the team learned and continued to modify the model according to
            the results. For example, in the journey with iterations and reflections, the team
            realized that they should not only extract images but piece different processing
            techniques together. They also adjusted the angle and height of the drone.</p>

          <h2>AI as a career opportunity</h2>

          <p>The fact that AI is more efficient and cost-effective does result in <a
            href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/08/17/how-robotics-and-automation-could-create-new-jobs-in-the-new-normal/">reduced
            labor hours</a>, which raises the concern that AI is taking jobs away from people.
            Titone said the better perspective was to view this as an opportunity. She said that
            upskilling employees to be able to work with AI was an investment in the workforce. If
            the employees understand AI, she said, they become more valuable as workers because they
            qualify for more advanced roles.</p>

          <browsispot>
            <div></div>
          </browsispot>

          <p>“I never approach AI as taking somebody’s job or role; the way I’ve always approached AI
            is that it should complement our workforce, that it should give us a set of skills and
            career paths that our teammates can take,” Titone said.</p>
